Hello, I'm Chris! I'm a senior rendering engineer at [The Coalition][TheCoalition]. My primary interests are anything to do with rendering (both real-time and offline) and occasionally dabbling in the art side of things. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science at [California Polytechnic State University][CalPoly]. Previously I was on the [Direct3D team][D3DTeam] where I worked on Direct3D 12 and DXR.
